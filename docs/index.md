# gRPC with FS2 and cats-effect

## What is...

!!! summary "gRPC"
    
    gRPC is an RPC protocol and set of implementations created by Google.

!!! summary "FS2"

!!! summary "cats-effect"

## Why do I want to use this?

If you want to use an FP approach to Scala programming, while using gRPC, then this
may be for you. 

Even if you are not sure about functional programming, you may find the programming
model to be easier to understand than an `Observable`-based API.

## Comparison with ScalaPB

This library leverages ScalaPB, but then provides a very different programmatic
API for writing your service.
